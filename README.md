# game-of-life

## Introduction

This is a Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. The game simulates the evolution of cells on a grid based on a set of simple rules. Each cell can either live, die, or reproduce, creating fascinating patterns.

This implementation generates a random state with some alive cells, and then runs the simulation as per the rules.
